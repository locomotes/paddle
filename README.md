June 4th:
Homework today is to recreate the Surf and Paddle mockup. Both the mockup and the images folder is attached below in a zip file.

This needs to be as pixel perfect as you can make it.

To help in this, I want you to use normalize.css which is a good css reset and will help you. 
You can find that here - http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

Also, you will need to utilize Google Fonts - http://www.google.com/fonts
The fonts used in this mockup are (Oswald and Myriad Pro) you can substitute Myriad Pro with PT Sans though.

This homework is due Monday morning by 9am and should be uploaded to your Github account titled something like "Surf and Paddle".

Please COMMENT on this message once you have completed that with a link to that particular repository.

June 10th: 
Create two branches of Surf and Paddle, one to convert your CSS to Sass and then one for your final Github Pages page.

First:
If you are still struggling with HTML/CSS please find Shane or myself this afternoon or hit us up on HipChat.
Continue to use the command line (Terminal) as much as possible during this assignment

In your Sass branch:
Set up a Sass file
Change any color used more than once into a Sass variable
Use at least one mixin
Include that mixin using a partial & import
Nest your Sass as much as possible

In your final gh-pages branch:
Push it live to Github Pages
Comment on the assignment page a link to that site

Bonus
Make all of your SCSS nested!
Also review Git Branching/Commiting by finishing - https://try.github.io
